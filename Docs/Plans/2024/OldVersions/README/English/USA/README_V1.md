# Things to do for 404 day (2024)

- Complete overhaul of document syntax (dropdowns, formatting of the file history section, other?)
- My instances of link rot (GitHub organizations, GitHub Pages, other?)
- Local data in repository (rather than `raw.githubusercontent.com`) I completely missed this in 2023, it was one of my goals
- `Section:Link-Rot`
- - See also: Software Rot
- If I have anything else that comes to mind, I won't write about it until 2024, Thursday, April 4th
