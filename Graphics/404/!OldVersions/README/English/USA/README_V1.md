# 404 collection

This folder aims to be a collection of 404 errors across as many sites as possible. It is a community sub-project.

## Style guide

- Raster images must be clear (on a monitor of resolutions ranging from 1920x1080 to 3840x2160) if the image is in vector format, this requirement is raised to to 3840x2160 to 65536x34560)
- Source images must be in either PNG, SVG, JPG, or JPEG format (GIF, TIF, BMP, WebP, and others are not allowed, due to quality, size, and compatibility issues)
- Images must be sorted properly (example: example.net must be placed in a folder titled `/Example/` within the folder `/E/`)
- Images must be named properly (example: `Example_Cropped_382x144.png`)
- All images MUST be stored locally in the repository (you cannot link to any website)
