Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of February 5th 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/404Day/issues/) make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/404Day repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/404Day), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

Due to maintenance issues, over 25 translations are out of date and are using Version 8 or Version 9 of this README file. A translator is needed. Also, as of April 1st 2021, it is going to take me a while to get all the new links working.

🎌️ **Flag guide** 🎌️

🚩️🏴️🏳️ Flags were beginning to get added in version 2 of this document. I was originally just going to add the Ukraine 🇺🇦️ flag, but decided to add more, until every language had at least 1 flag. They were done purely with the existing knowledge of the developer. In version 3, flags were added for every language. There are some notes that go with this:

🌐️ **[Unions `🇪🇺️` and Nations `🇺🇳️`]** 🌐️

Languages listed here that are official languages of the European Union have a European Union flag `🇪🇺️` next to them. As of 2022 March 14th, there are currently 27 languages recognized by the European Union, from 27 different member states.

Languages listed here that are official languages of the United Nations have a United Nations flag `🇺🇳️` next to them. As of 2022 March 14th, there are currently 6 languages recognized by the European Union (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish) alongside 193 different member states and 2 observer states.

🌏️ **[One China (PRC) `🇨🇳️` Two China (Taiwan) `🇹🇼️` Hong Kong `🇭🇰️` and Macau `🇲🇴️`]** 🌏️

For neutrality reasons, languages listed here that have an official majority in Chinese speakers will receive all 4 of these flags, even if the language isn't Chinese or in the Sino family of languages.

🌐️ **[Global languages `🌐️`]** 🌐️

Currently, 1 global language is listed, and that is Esperanto. Esperanto is not native to any countries, its goal is to be a universal _lingua franca_ (Latin translation: _bridge language_) it is represented with a `globe with meridians` or `🌐️`

💞️ **[Regarding sexuality 🏳️‍🌈️]** 💞️

Sexuality is not measured here, I feel it would be unnecessary, as you are picking out a language, not a sexuality.

💠️ **[Location of flag 🚩️]** 💠️

Flags are located at the end of each language name (after the Romanization) with one space before, to the right.

Like this:

**[Pl Polski Polish 🇵🇱️]**

But not like this:

**[Pl Polski 🇵🇱️ Polish]**

And also not like this:

**[Pl 🇵🇱️ Polski Polish]**

**2022.03.12**

I was so angry and frustrated. I didn't save the file, and my computer randomly froze up twice, then crashed. I had to re-add all the flags, it took an hour to do so originally, and I was just seconds away from finishing. I couldn't save the file quick enough. Luckily, all the research was still in my head, and there was no data that wasn't easily replacable (identically) so it is a type of important work that was the best thing to lose, since it was the easiest to recreate, taking me less than 20 minutes

**Other notes:**

⚠️ A language is missing: `Latvian`

ℹ️ Possibly supporting the next 126 languages that are going to be added to Google Translate

🗜️ Plans to automate this process with the [`@AUTOMATE2001`](https://github.com/AUTOMATE-2001) bot

⛔️ Need to find a way to work with these languages on services other than Google Translate.

⚠️ There might be noticeable lag in this section due to how many flag emojis are in use.

# 404Day
`<404 Error: day not found>` April 4th 2021 (4.04) is now a new technical holiday to celebrate hyperlinks, and to raise awareness on Link rot (Hyperlink celebration day, Link Rot Awareness day) 

***

## About

See above. This repository aims to be the homepage for the HTTP 404 error as a holiday. Nobody created a technical holiday for it yet, and it has 2 significant important things to recognize:

1. To celebrate hyperlinks and their importance (hyperlink recognition day, 404 day)

2. To recognize the problems of link rot (Linkrot recognition day)

This project is a humor project, but at the same time is a serious project.

404 Day is also commonly known as Web masters day.

This year, you should also help fight Internet censorship in libraries, the EFF supports it. [https://www.eff.org/event/404-day](https://www.eff.org/event/404-day)

[`Source 1 (www.vice.com)`](https://www.vice.com/en/article/8qxgk5/today-is-404-day-because-the-web-is-breaking/)

### Unrelated

In Atlanta Georgia (US) 404 day is a self-proclaimed holiday that started in 2021.

[`Source 2 (atlanticdailyworld.com)`](https://atlantadailyworld.com/2022/04/04/404-day-in-atlanta-is-celebration-of-culture-and-purpose/)

### How to celebrate 404 day

#### Salute the fallen

Remember websites that have gone down.

#### Try to prevent link rot

See below.

## Link rot

### What is link rot?

Link rot is a common issue, where websites go down or have their pages moved around, which results in hyperlinks 'rotting' (becoming dead links)

### Types of link rot

These are the 5 types of link rot (I made 3 of them up (Query rot, Anchor rot, Fuzzy rot), as a term for them didn't exist yet, or I couldn't find one, possibly due to link rot)

#### General

##### Website rot

**Importance:** `Very high`

When a website goes down (such as `https://www.example.com/`) so do all of its links.

##### Page rot

**Importance:** `High/Very high`

When a webpage goes down, it is no longer accessible.

##### Query rot

**Importance:** `Low`

When a query (such as `?id=11111`) stops working, this is also a form of link rot.

##### Anchor rot

**Importance:** `Very low/low`

When an anchor link no longer works (such as `#rotten`) this is a form of link rot

##### Fuzzy rot

**Importance:** `None`

When you can't enter any text you want (eg: `jshfkdhfkfh`) and get a result.

#### What can be done to prevent it?

##### Crawling services

Crawling services (such as [the wayback machine](http://wayback.archive.org/) a part of the Internet Archive) help to reduce the amount of link rot by archiving websites that have gone down or changed too much. These services aren't free to operate, but are free to use. It is recommended you [donate to the Internet archive](https://archive.org/donate/) to keep this great service running, and prevent it from becoming one of the biggest incidents of link rot to date (if it can't be funded, it will go down, and we will lose trillions of links, and a great deal of priceless Internet history)

##### Be careful where you upload

Sites like YouTube, TikTok, and almost all other social media sites have stability issues, and can take content down at any time, even without violating their terms of service. Note that sites like YouTube will likely go down in the future if they continue operating in the way they do. Also, entire YouTube channels are often deleted at random, due to abuse of the DMCA, an overly broad change to the terms of service, or another illicit reason (YouTube is being noted here, as it is one of the biggest sites that is in constant danger)

##### Donate to the sites that matter

Websites like archive.org, wikipedia.org, and other important sites should be donated to, so that their operators can continue to keep them running for the current generation, along with future generations. Even just a $1.00/month donation can mean life or death, especially when most people don't donate. It all adds up.

### 404 collection

Starting on 2023 Webmasters day, this project was heavily updated, and received important new documentation. It also received a new [`404 collection`](/Graphics/404/), a collection of 404 pages across various sites. It is a major work in progress, and is community run. Check out the link for more details.

### Requests

**Importance:** `Very low`

GitHub has some queries that shouldn't result in 404. The most notable one (to me) is typing `https://github.com/NEW` instead of `https://github.com/new` most pages aren't case sensitive, so why is this still happening?

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
